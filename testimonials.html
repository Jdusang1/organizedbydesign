                            "Cindy helped me organize our kids' playroom. It had been an eyesore for
                            years. I was embarrassed for people see it when they came over. Cindy was so helpful in the
                            decluttering process."

                            "Cindy had a nice way of encouraging the purge of many things my boys really didn't need
                            anymore-which was a necessary step in organizing the room. " She then helped me pick out a
                            more useful piece of furniture for the space which I felt we really needed."

                            "I am planning on asking her to return to help it still looks great thanks to the new system
                            she put in place for us. I am so excited to show friends this room now"

                            "Her pricing was very reasonable, and worth every penny!"

                        I recently moved from Denver to Grand Junction and felt so overwhelmed by
                        all of the things I've accumulated over the years. It was to the point I just couldn't dig
                        into it all by myself so I did nothing and it was depressing. I found Cindy, she organized a
                        huge section of items for me to sell and completely organized my garage and parts in my
                        home. I now know what all I have and can get rid of a ton of stuff, I can breathe again! I
                        highly highly recommend Cindy and will personally talk with someone if desired. Just hire
                        her! She's Awesome!

                    We are writing to thank you for the excellent job you did from start to
                    finish handling our estate sale. When you came to our house, we were impressed by your
                    extensive knowledge of everything from furniture to the collectible antiques. Your
                    experience and trustworthy nature put us as ease, and we knew that you were the right
                    company for us. As our parents sincerely needed help with the liquidation of their estate,
                    it was most important to us to have an honest person handling the liquidation.

                    We appreciate the prompt manner in which you and your staff combed through years of storage,
                    and the home to set up the sale. The estate sale was a complete success because of your
                    professionalism, experience, and resources. We believe your use of social media, and
                    personal contacts to attract buyers and dealers was beneficial and substantially increased
                    the number of visitors to the sale.

                    It was a pleasure doing business with your company. If a future potential client would like
                    to speak to someone youâ€™ve done and estate sale for, please have them contact us.

                    Our thanks to you and your team; we are grateful for all that you did and we will certainly
                    recommend you to those we know when the need to liquidate their estate arises.


                    Sincerely,
