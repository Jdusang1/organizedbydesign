                        <p class="card-text">"Cindy helped me organize our kids' playroom. It had been an eyesore for
                            years. I was embarrassed for people see it when they came over. Cindy was so helpful in the
                            decluttering process."

                            "Cindy had a nice way of encouraging the purge of many things my boys really didn't need
                            anymore-which was a necessary step in organizing the room. " She then helped me pick out a
                            more useful piece of furniture for the space which I felt we really needed."

                            "I am planning on asking her to return to help it still looks great thanks to the new system
                            she put in place for us. I am so excited to show friends this room now"

                            "Her pricing was very reasonable, and worth every penny!"

                        <p class="card-text">I recently moved from Denver to Grand Junction and felt so overwhelmed by
                            all of the things I've accumulated over the years. It was to the point I just couldn't dig
                            into it all by myself so I did nothing and it was depressing. I found Cindy, she organized a
                            huge section of items for me to sell and completely organized my garage and parts in my
                            home. I now know what all I have and can get rid of a ton of stuff, I can breathe again! I
                            highly highly recommend Cindy and will personally talk with someone if desired. Just hire
                            her! She's Awesome!
